Spelling, grammar and style checker for Portuguese, with or without the Spelling Reform of 1990.
== Description ==
Check the spelling, grammar and style of your texts with FLiP, the proofing tools used daily in the largest Portuguese language content publishers. This plugin includes proofing tools for European and Brazilian Portuguese, both pre and post Spelling Reform of 1990. Vertical dictionaries that group tens of specific knowledge domains are also available to quickly proof read texts of specific areas like Medicine, Chemistry or Law. It is possible to select one of three writing styles: normal, formal and informal.

IMPORTANT: The free version of the plugin only checks the spelling of the texts in the pre 1990 Spelling Reform and doesn’t present any suggestions for the errors. This means that no grammar and style checking is done and only texts following the pre 1990 Spelling Reform can be used.
To unleash all the features of the plugin you should get a key to have access to Priberam’s proofing API.
